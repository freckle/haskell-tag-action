# Haskell Tag Action

Creates a tag for the current version of a Haskell project, if it doesn't
already exist. Presumably, creation of this tag should trigger more automation,
such as [uploading to Hackage][stack-upload-action].

[stack-upload-action]: https://github.com/freckle/stack-upload-action

## Usage

## Examples

```yaml
- uses: freckle/haskell-tag-action@v1
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

If a tag is created, it'll be found in `outputs.tag`.

### Publishing a Hackage Package

```yaml
jobs:
  tag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: tag
        uses: freckle/haskell-tag-action@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    outputs:
      tag: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.tag }}

  release:
    needs: [tag]
    if: needs.tag.outputs.tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: freckle/stack-upload-action@v1
        env:
          HACKAGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HACKAGE_UPLOAD_API_KEY }}
```

### GitHub Release with Executables attached

```yaml
jobs:
  tag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: tag
        uses: freckle/haskell-tag-action@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    outputs:
      tag: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.tag }}

  create-release:
    needs: [tag]
    if: needs.tag.outputs.tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/create-release@v1
        id: create-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ needs.tag.outputs.tag }}
          # Additional options...
    outputs:
      upload_url: ${{ steps.create-release.outputs.upload_url }}

  upload-assets:
    needs: create-release
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      # Build executables...
      - uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ needs.create-release.outputs.upload_url }}
          # Additional options...
```

## Inputs

See [`action.yml`](./action.yml) for details.

## Motivation & Alternatives

When we release Haskell packages to Hackage, the steps are always the same:

1. Open a PR with version bump and CHANGELOG for review or visibility
2. Merge that change
3. Push a tag for that version
4. Automation sees the tag and uploads to Hackage

(3) is a bit tedious and surprisingly error-prone.

Often, projects will automate this by using [Semantic Commits][sc]. As changes
land in `main`, commit message conventions determine how large of a version bump
to make, and then automation creates an appropriate release at that version.

This just doesn't work for us. Instead, we want to control versions and releases
more collaboratively, via step (1) above. This Action represents our current
compromise.

## Caveats

To simplify this Action we do the following:

1. Expect `package.yaml` and do not support reading `*.cabal` directly
1. Read `version: ` naively (via `sed`)

PRs welcome (Including rewriting in a Real Language :tm:).
